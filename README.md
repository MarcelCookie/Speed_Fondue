# Speed_Fondue
This project is part of my web dev training. The goal is to create a landing page from scratch
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

To spice things up, I've decided to create a landing page for a delivery service that offers ready to eat fondue at our door step in less than 30 minutes. A Savoyard nightmare

The **skills** I will demonstrate:
- create an entire web page based on design guidelines using HTML and CSS stylesheet 
- use flexbox layout concept
